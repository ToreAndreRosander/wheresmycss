# wheresmycss by Rosander

A little script to display HTML classes that has missing selectors in the style sheets.
Usefull if you are working on migration projects or troubleshooting websites with little or none documentation.

Include the wheresMyCss.js inside the head element to be able to intiate the MutationObserver API in the browser.
The script will output missing css selectors in the console.
